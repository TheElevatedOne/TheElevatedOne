## Hello and Welcome to my Profile! ðŸ˜„ 
### My name is Adam MladÃ½, publically known as ELEVATED.
### I am an Autistic Person exploring every nook and cranny to find interesting things to learn and work on.
---
### **My Background:**
- I was born, study and live in Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°
- I finished a "grammar" high school *(it's "gymnÃ¡zium" in Slovak, it means a high school where you learn everything you would need to get into a university and not fail)*
- I currently study at the Faculty of Management and Informatics at the University of Å½ilina (FRI UNIZA) in the Computer Science department.

### **My Work Experience:**
- None. Really, None. At least in the field of informatics, None. Internships here are kinda hard to come by.

### **About Myself:**
- I am a self-diagnosed autistic person via the [RAADS-R](https://embrace-autism.com/raads-r/) test
- I can say that I am a Programmer, an Amateur Astrophotographer, an Amateur Audio Engineer and Music Producer, an AI Model Trainer and Artist and bunch more things I dabbled in.
